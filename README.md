## **Project Description**
This project aims to use an all-optical BCI to study synaptic plasticity during sensorimotor learning in mice, providing insights into learning deficits in disease models.Using real-time imaging data from individual cortical neurons, animals will learn to modulate neural activity patterns and move a virtual cursor toward a target. In addition to the functional readout, the imaging also allows us to scan synaptic connections and observe how they change over the course of BCI training. This project will provide unprecedented insights into how subcellular synaptic processes drive skill acquisition. Once validated in healthy animals, this approach can be applied to disease models such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to uncover the aberrant synaptic mechanisms underlying learning deficits. This innovative combination of imaging, closed-loop neural control, and real-time adaptability makes the project uniquely positioned to inform therapeutic strategies and improve understanding of learning disorders.  

## **Primary Objective**
Develop a rapid, real-time neural decoding algorithm to control a 2D cursor based on calcium transient dynamics recorded using two-photon imaging in healthy animals, with plans to extend this approach to ASD models. 

## **Basic Goals**
- Motion Correction: Process two-photon microscopy imaging frames to correct for motion artifacts, ensuring stable spatial alignment of neurons across frames.
- Image Segmentation: Develop tools to identify and segment neuronal regions of interest (ROIs) based on calcium signal activity.
- Calcium Trace Extraction: Extract fluorescence traces from identified ROIs and identify calcium transients, which represent neuronal firing events.
- Complete all of these steps within a <100 ms time period per imaging frame.

## **Intermediate Goals**
- Neural Decoding Algorithm: Develop an algorithm that translates calcium transient events into directional commands, enabling the real-time control of a 2D virtual cursor.
- Event-Based Analysis: Quantify the frequency, amplitude, and timing of calcium transients to evaluate their relationship with task performance and cursor movements.

## **Advanced Goals**
- Dynamic Neural Manifold Representation: Enable real-time adaptation of the decoder by switching to different subpopulations of neurons or adjusting decoding parameters based on calcium transient patterns. Test how animals adapt to these changes.
- Calcium Transient Clustering: Investigate spatial and temporal clustering of calcium transients among neurons during skill acquisition and how this relates to learning rates.
